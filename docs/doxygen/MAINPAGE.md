# TrackAsia Native Core Documentation

This is the documentation of the public C++ API of TrackAsia Native Core. You would normally only use this API if you are a contributor to one of the platform specific APIs. If you want to intergrate use TrackAsia Native in your project, you are better served by [documentation specific to your platform](https://trackasia.org/projects/trackasia-native/), unless you are interested in the internals of TrackAsia Native.

The source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/track-asia/trackasia-native) (the `include` directory contains the public API).
